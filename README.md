# Deep Learning with Keras

Work project on Lynda.com course on [Deep Learning with Keras](https://www.lynda.com/Google-TensorFlow-tutorials/Building-Deep-Learning-Applications-Keras-2-0/601801-2.html).  

[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/cntk), or [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano). It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.
